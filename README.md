Document Verification Project (Hackathon)

This is my first hackathon project, and I'm thrilled to share it with you! The Document Verification Dashboard is designed to automate the document verification process, making it much more efficient than the usual manual methods, whether dealing with digital or physical documents. ðŸ“‘âœ¨

The system leverages OCR (Optical Character Recognition) ðŸ¤– and other automated technologies to instantly identify and validate documents directly through an API ðŸ”‘. This means that companies or organizations can quickly verify documents sourced from government databases without the need for manual intervention, reducing human error and speeding up the entire process. âš¡

The dashboard is user-friendly, enabling easy access to document verification tasks. By automating what is traditionally a time-consuming and error-prone process, we aim to make the verification process faster, more accurate, and more scalable. 

Note: This project was developed in response to the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) DRDO problem statement, addressing a real-world requirement for faster document validation.
